## Exercise 2

1. For a column you transformed to numbers, edit one or two cells, replacing the numbers with text (such as <code>abc</code>) or blank (no number or text). You will need to change the <code>Data type</code> to <code>text</code> using the drop-down menu.
1. Use the column pulldown menu to apply a numeric facet to the column you edited. The facet will appear in the left panel.
1. Notice that there are several checkboxes in this facet: <code>Numeric</code>, <code>Non-numeric</code>, <code>Blank</code>, and <code>Error</code>. Below these checkboxes are counts of the number of cells in each category. You should see checks for <code>Non-numeric</code> and <code>Blank</code> if you changed some values.
1. Experiment with checking or unchecking these boxes to select subsets of your data.
