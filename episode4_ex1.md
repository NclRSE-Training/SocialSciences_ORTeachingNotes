## Exercise 1

Transform three more columns, <code>no_members</code>, <code>years_liv</code>, and <code>buildings_in_compound</code>, from text to numbers. Can all columns be transformed to numbers? - Try it with <code>village</code> for example.

<details>
  <summary>
    Solution
  </summary>

    Only observations that include only numerals (0-9) can be transformed to numbers. If you apply a number transformation to a column that doesnâ€™t meet this criteria, and then click the <code>Undo / Redo</code> tab, you will see a step that starts with <code>Text transform on 0 cells</code>. This means that the data in that column was not transformed.
